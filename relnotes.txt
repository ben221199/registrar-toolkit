July 18, 2000

This release inlcudes minor fixes to the RRP C and Java APIs. 
In addition, this SDK is now being released under the GNU Lesser 
General Public License. Please review the lgpl-license.txt file 
for further information.

The RRP 1.1.0 specification document has been removed from this 
release. The RRP specification is now published by the IETF as 
RFC2832. Please refer to following URL for the most current 
RRP specification (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2832.txt).

This distribution contains the following files:
1. relnotes.txt (this file)
2. install.txt
3. readme.txt
4. lgpl-license.txt
5. Documentation directory: Javadoc for the Java RRP API, C API document, 
and Enabling SSL documentation
6. API directory: contains the C and the Java RRP APIs, including the source
code.

The following changes have been implemented in the RRP C API:

1. The RRP Session command (RRPStartSession) has been modified. 
The variable parameter list has been removed from the function 
due to the invalid use of the va_start, va_end, and va_args macros. 
Prior to this release the third parameter was an optional character 
pointer to a new registrar password. This function now requires the 
third parameter. It is acceptable to pass NULL when there is no need 
to change the registrar password.

2. The RRP Renew command (RRPRenewDomain) has been modified.
The variable parameter list has been removed from the function 
due to the invalid use of the va_start, va_end, and va_args macros. 
Prior to this release the function had two optional parameters of 
type integer. The two optional parameters were the renewal registration
period and the current expiration date of the domain being renewed.
This function now requires these two parameters. It is acceptable to 
pass -1 or 0 when the Registry default values are desired. 

2. The RRP Add command (RRPAddDomain) has been modified.
The variable parameter list has been removed from the function 
due to the invalid use of the va_start, va_end, and va_args macros. 
Prior to this release the function had an optional parameter of 
type integer. The optional parameter was the initial registration
period of the domain being added. This function now requires this 
parameter. It is acceptable to pass -1 or 0 when the Registry default 
value is desired. 

The following changes have been implemented in the RRP Java API:

1. The RRPSession constructor was modified to set the correct
socket timeout value passed in to the method.

---------------------

December 3, 1999

This release includes an RRP specifications document written in
Internet-Draft format.  Though the NSI Registry is actively engaged
in an effort to publish RRP 1.1.0 as an Internet-Draft, the version
included with this SDK has not been published by the IETF and is
subject to editorial revisions before it is officially published.
The final version of the document will be available directly from
the IETF after it has been reviewed and accepted as an Internet-Draft.

Please note that the RRP specifications document included with this
release remains subject to all provisions of your confidentiality
and licensing arrangements with the NSI Registry.

This distribution contains the following files:
1. relnotes.txt (this file)
2. install.txt
3. readme.txt
4. license.txt
5. Documentation directory: contains the RRP specifications document,
Javadoc for the Java RRP API, C API document, and Enabling SSL
documentation
6. API directory: contains the C and the Java RRP APIs, including the source
code.

The following changes have been implemented in the RRP and the C and Java
RRP APIs:

1. The RRP Renew command has been modified to support two new options,
"CurrentExpirationYear" and "Period". This has resulted in a modification to
both the Java and C APIs. The request to renew a domain name MAY contain the
renewal period in years for the domain being renewed in a single instance of
a "Period" parameter and a single instance of a "CurrentExpirationYear"
parameter. These parameters MUST appear together if either is specified,
though the order in which the parameters appear is insignificant. Please
refer to the RRP v1.1.0 specification for a more detailed description of
the RRP Renew command.

2. The RRP Add command has been modified to allow the user to specify
the registration period for all new domain registrations. This has resulted 
in a modification to both the Java and C APIs. Please refer to the RRP v1.1.0
specification for a more detailed description of the RRP Add command.

3. The RRP response codes have been modified

  3 new response codes have been added to RRP:

	- 554 Domain already registered
	- 555 Domain already renewed
	- 556 Maximum registration period exceeded

  3 response codes have been remove from RRP:

	- 120 Server closing connection
	- 121 Idle timeout. Server closing connection
	- 122 Session expired. Server closing connection

All 3 of the conditions described by these response codes will be reported
using response code 520 "Server closing connection. Client should try
opening new connection".

Please refer to the RRP v1.1.0 specification for a more detailed description
of these response codes.

This release contains the following files:
1. relnotes.txt (this file)
2. readme.txt
3. license.txt
4. Documentation directory: contains the RRP specifications document in
PDF format, Javadoc for the Java RRP API, C API document, and Enabling
SSL documentation
5. API directory: contains the C and the Java RRP APIs, including the
source code.

The following changes have been implemented in the RRP and the C and Java
RRP APIs:

1. The RRP Check command has been modified to allow the user to check
for name server availability. If a name server is not available, then
the IP address(es) of that name server will be returned. This has resulted
in a modification to both the Java and C APIs.

2. The RRP Session command has been modified to allow the registrar to
modify their logon password while creating an authenticated session.
This modification has resulted in a modification to both the Java and C APIs.

3. Both APIs now support a new timeout feature to prevent hung connections.

The following changes have been implemented regarding our SSL client
authentication policies:

1. All registrars are now required to obtain one or more RSA certificates
from Thawte (http://wwww.thawte.com) or Verisign (http:/www.verisign.com). We
are currently not accepting self-signed certificates or DSA certificates.
