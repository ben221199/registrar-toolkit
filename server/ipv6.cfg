# File name: ipv6.cfg
# Author: Suresh Yalamanchilli syalamanchilli@verisign.com
# 
# This configuration file identifies IPv6 address block ranges reserved by
# IANA.  IP addresses that fall within these ranges are NOT available
# for general use, and they should thus NOT be used for name servers.
# The bulk of these reservations are documented by IANA.

# The perl code that reads this file converts each address into a table of
# min and max values.  An incoming IP address is converted to number
# format and then compared to the entries in the table to see if the number
# falls within one of the restricted ranges.  If it does, the IP address
# can't be used for a name server.
